# Netflix-Webscraping
This program loads your Netflix data from a JSON file, extracts the list of movies and TV shows, and calculates various statistics such as the total number of movies and TV shows, the total runtime, and the average rating. In order to use your own Netflix data, you will have to create your own JSON file based on your own Netflix data.
